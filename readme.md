# Advanced React + GraphQL

These are the starter files and stepped solutions for the [Advanced React and GraphQL](https://AdvancedReact.com) course by Wes Bos. 

## Advanced Vue + GraphQL

When starting the course I decided to challenge myself by converting the course content to [Vue](https://vuejs.org) while moving along. Next has been replaced with [nuxtjs](https://nuxtjs.org) and for the GraphQL connectivity [Vue Apollo](https://akryum.github.io/vue-apollo/) is used.

The files can be found in [tree/master/sick-fits/frontend-vue](https://github.com/mwidmann/Advanced-React/tree/master/sick-fits/frontend-vue).
